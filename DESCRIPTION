Description: Implements a local likelihood estimator for the dependence parameter in bivariate conditional copula models.  Copula family and local likelihood bandwidth parameters are selected by leave-one-out cross-validation.  The models are implemented in 'TMB', meaning that the local score function is efficiently calculated via automated differentiation (AD), such that quasi-Newton algorithms may be used for parameter estimation.
